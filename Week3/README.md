# CMEE Coursework Week 3 Repository

*Author: Lucy Goodyear*  
*Created: 14/10/19*

This repository contains all the CMEE coursework from Week 3 on R.

**Code** contains the scripts/programs.

**Data** is the data needed to run those scripts.

**Results** is where the outpout from those scripts is sent to.

**Sandbox** is a miscellaneous directory containing experimental code and data.

## Requirements

R v.3.6.1

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux.

## List of scripts

1. [sample](#1.-sample)
2. [basic_io](#2.-basic_io)
3. [control_flow](#3.-control_flow)


### 1. sample

A .R script that generates 50 normal random numbers and runs a function to randomly select a smaple of those. If the sample contains more than 30 unique elements, the mean is then calculated and printed for each sample. 100 iterations are done this function, first using vectorisation and then a for loop.

### 2. basic_io

A simple .R script to illustrate R input-output. It runs line by line and checks inputs and outputs to understand what is happening.

###  3. control_flow

A .R script that practises different control flow tools.

### 4. break

A .R script that uses ```break``` to break out of a simple loop.

### 5. next

A .R script that uses next to skip to the next iteration of a loop. The loop checks which numbers between 1 and 10 are odd by using the modulo operation and then all odd numbers are printed.
