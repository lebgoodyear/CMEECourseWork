# CMEE Coursework C Week Repository

*Author: Lucy Goodyear*  
*Created: 05/12/19*

This repository contains all the CMEE coursework from Week 10 on C.

This is not a compulsory course for MRes so is not included with the other weeks.

**Code** contains the scripts/programs.

The **TreeLib** directory within **Code** contains the initial header files
and C script to make a library that contains all the functions needed for 
generating phylogenetic trees.

C_Week_Notes.md is a markdown file of notes I have made during the lectures.

## Requirements

A compiler for the C programming language.

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux.

## List of scripts
1. hello
2. var1
3. vars2
4. ranges
5. operators
6. bitwise
7. dna
8. pointers
9. pointers_to_arrays
10. pointers_ret
11. composite_data_types
12. safearray
13. malloc_calloc

## Script content

The above C scripts ecover the following C concepts:
- basic C structure
- data types
- variables
- operators
- bitwise operations
- loops and functions
- pointers
- using structs
- safe programming
- assigning and freeing memory
