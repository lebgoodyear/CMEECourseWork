This repository contains all the coursework for the first term of the CMEE Master's course. Each of the main directories contains its own readme detailing the subdirectories, the system requirements to run each script and a description of the contents of each script.

Note that the **C(Week10)** directory does not have the same nomenclature as the other teaching weeks because it is a non-compulsory course for MRes students.
