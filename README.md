This repository contains all the coursework for the first term of the CMEE Master's course. Each of the main directories contains its own readme detailing the subdirectories, the system requirements to run each script and a description of the contents of each script.

Note that the **C(Week10)** directory does not have the same nomenclature as the other teaching weeks because it is a non-compulsory course for MRes students.

* 4 scripts modeling the Lotka-Voltera system:
    * numerical integration version
    * numerical integration version with carrying capacity
    * discrete time version
    * discrete time steps version with random gaussian fluctuation
* Practicals on visualsing networks
* Practice scripts using regular expressions
* Practice scripts running R scripts from python and accessing command line functions through python

### Week 8: MiniProject

This directory is empty, created for file structure continuity. See MiniProject folder for work done during this week.

### Week 9: HPC

* Main .R script containing all HPC functions on neutral theory and fracals
* Test .R script, which sources the main script and contains suitable parameters to test the functions.
* Cluster .R script which contains the code to be run on the cluster
