   abstract = {Trophic interactions govern biomass fluxes in ecosystems, and stability in food webs. Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 × 10 -14 kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {The following is largely the author's summary. In this paper, the model of a basically simple type of predation 52 542, in which the components are rate of searching, the period of exposure of prey to predator and the time spent in handling each prey, is extended to include the effects of hunger. In order to make the model realistic, an analytical approach (the experimental components analysis) was developed to assure an intimate co-ordination between theory and experiment, each alternately dictating the other. The actions and interactions of each subcomponent of the process were analysed experimentally, making use chiefly of laboratory data on the Mantid Hierodula crassa G.-T. preying on Musca domestica L., and equations adequately describing each of the relevant fragments of this system were developed. The aim was to preserve three features that imparted a distinctive character to the complexity of the predation process, namely, the influence of both past and current conditions, the importance of thresholds and limits, and a basic discontinuous character resulting from the relatively few contacts between predator and prey. These three features were preserved by using difference equations and expressing them in Fortran, a language designed for I.B.M. digital computers. Both language and computer (I.B.M. 1620) were ideally suited to deal with the complexity arising from the three features, and since these characterize many biological systems the combination of an experimental components analysis with computer languages and techniques could be profitably applied to many biological problems cf. 55 1373. The resulting predation model accurately predicted the effects of prey density and time on the amount of attack and hunger level shown by the predator. A preliminary simulation study showed that two types of functional response to prey density can be generated, a general case in which the curve shows a negatively accelerated rise to a plateau and a limiting one in which the rise is linear. One or other of these two curves describes the responses of all examples of attack by invertebrate predators (12 species, of which eight are insects and one a mite) for which information is available cf. 49 178; 50 528; 52 489, 545, but not those of vertebrates cf. 55 2004. An extensive simulation study making use of the model to demonstrate the kinds of attack that can occur in nature and the significance of various features of attack with respect to biological control is in progress. The development of simplified versions of the model to enable it to be used in specific situations in the field is proposed and exemplified by a simple equation based on data for H. crassa preying on M. domestica and relating the amount of prey within the predator to the number of prey attacked per day. Output from the complete predation model shows the precise conditions under which such a relation can be used.},

   abstract = {1. We derived a functional response function that accounted for both predator and prey size. Laboratory experiments were then performed to investigate the size relationships of the functional response of the benthic isopod Saduria entomon (L.) feeding on Monoporeia affinis (Lindström) amphipods. 2. The S. entomon predators, in general, showed sigmoid (type III) functional responses. The attack rate of S. entomon was a bent ridge-shaped function of predator and prey size. The maximum attack rates of small predators were found on small prey, and then attack rate declined rapidly as prey size increased. In large predators attack rate increased slowly up to a maximum for large prey. The shape of the attack rate was dependent on the size scaling of predator and prey body mass in the attack rate function. We suggest that the ridge-shaped attack rate function found in our study is likely to be general for predators that feed on prey with a large size range. The handling time of small S. entomon increased rapidly as prey size increased. In contrast, we found only small differences in handling time of large predators. The complete functional response may provide size-refuges for very small and large M. affinis depending on the size-structure of S. entomon. 3. To investigate the realism in our functional response estimates, we incorporated the functional response in a consumption model based on the densities and size-structures of the predator and the prey in the field (Bothnian Sea). We adjusted the attack rate using a correction factor to predict the observed survival of the different age-classes of M. affinis from field samples. The field data-based consumption model accounted for 1 year of size-dependent predation by the size-structured population of S. entomon on M. affinis. In addition, using a growth model for S. entomon we checked that the predicted consumption by the predator gave realistic growth curves. We found that the experimentally derived attack rates may have been overestimated by a factor of 400.},

   abstract = {We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that realistically incorporates handling (i.e., attacking and eating) and digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our model, we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent further foraging activities (i.e., searching and handling). Instead, we let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator searches for new prey. Additionally, our model takes into account time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state, we term it the steady-state satiation (SSS) equation. The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e., asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time, for prey density approaching infinity). According to this formula, maximum predation rate is determined not by the sum of the time spent for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types: handling-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by handling time) and digestion-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by digestion time). We give examples of both predator types. Based on available data, we suggest that most predators are digestion limited. The SSS equation is a conceptual mechanistic model. Two possible applications of this model are that (1) it can be used to calculate the effects of changing predator or prey characteristics (e.g., defenses) on predation rate and (2) optimal foraging models based on the SSS equation are testable alternatives to other approaches. This may improve optimal foraging theory, since one of its major problems has been the lack of alternative models.},

   abstract = { Holling's Type II functional-response relationship is presented, and the formulations expressing the underlying organismal interactions which might generate such a relation arc generalized into the Type III response typical of predators showing learning behavior. An equation derived through an analogy with allosteric enzyme kinetics is given which will account for both Type II and Type III responses. The response behavior can be explained by three parameters: maximal feeding rate (F); an affinity constant (G) related to handling times, capture efficiencies, etc.; and the number of encounters (n) a predator must have with a prey item before becoming maximally efficient at utilizing the prey item as a resource. A discussion follows on the biological processes which result in shifts from Type II to Type III functional responses. Most of the learning processes involve changes in predator behavior associated with increasing encounters with prey, thus supporting parameter n as a major determinant in shifting thc functional response. Three hypotheses concerning the values parameters F, G, and n will assume under different ecological situations are posited: (l) food preferences will be reflected in an increase in resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G) and a decrease in values of n encounters; (2) a size ordering of the predators will result in shifts up in the resource-utilization efficiency (F) and affinity (G); while (3) increasing habitat complexity will generate decreases in n and F. }

   abstract = {Predator-prey dynamics is most simply and commonly described by Lotka-Volterra-type ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for continuous population density variables in the limit of large population sizes. One popular extension of these ODEs is the so-called Rosenzweig-MacArthur model in which various interaction rates between the populations have a nonlinear dependence on the prey concentration. Nonlinear 'functional responses' of this type were originally proposed by Holling on the basis of a general argument concerning the allocation of a predator's time between two activities: 'prey searching' and 'prey handling'.Although these functional responses are constructed in terms of the behaviour of an individual predator, they are routinely incorporated at the population level in models that include reproduction and death. In this paper we derive a novel three variable model for the simplest possible mathematical formulation of predator-prey dynamics that allows the interplay between these various processes to take place, on their different characteristic timescales. We study its properties in detail and show how it reduces to Holling's functional responses in special limits. As a result we are able to establish direct links between individual-level and population-level behaviour in the context of these well-known functional responses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A. This paper attempts to clarify the subject by giving a systematic account of the processes considered to be involved in the natural control of animal populations. B. First, a brief survey is made of the chief types of theories offering an explanation of natural control. The earlier theories looked to natural enemies as the main agents of control. Somewhat later theories gave predominance to physical factors. Control has been attributed exclusively to competition, including competition between natural enemies, or, more broadly, to density-dependent mortality. Among theories of periodic fluctuations, many ascribe control to some aspect of overpopulation of the environment, while mathematical theories envisage control due primarily to natural enemies. Certain `comprehensive' theories lay emphasis on the complexity and essential interconnectedness of the population-environment system, and hold that the particular causes of control vary with the circumstances. C. The elements of natural control are outlined as follows: C1. The numerical variation of populations is often considerable and yet is kept within certain limits. C2. A population and the items of its environment form a closely interconnected complex or ecosystem. The relationships of a population are with the whole ecosystem (which includes itself) rather than with the environment only. C3. The distinction between density-dependent and density-independent action is discussed, with examples; it by no means corresponds to the division between biotic and physical factors. Density-dependent action is defined as that which intensifies (per individual) as population density increases, and relaxes as density falls; it is the chief agent of control. Some processes are inversely related to density. Control of a population is a result of the limited capacity of the ecosystem with respect to that species or with respect to its enemies or both. The limiting influence begins to operate at densities far below the capacity limit, intensifying as this limit is approached; this is the basis of most kinds of density dependence (the other kinds are modifications of environmental capacity, the degree of modification naturally depending on density). An enemy is density-dependent in its action on a host (or prey) population if it attacks a greater proportion as the host density increases. The enemy will do this if it is capable, and if the supply of the host is a limiting factor in the enemy's environment. The presence of competitor species, and sometimes that of alternative hosts or prey for the enemies of a population, tends to intensify the action of the control factors involved. C4. Four phases of control are distinguished: limitation, which sets a variable upper limit; conservation, which tends to prevent extreme reduction; suppression, or a forced decline from high density; and release, a temporary escape from normal control after a severe reduction. Each is brought about by characteristic density relationships. Suppression and release promote fluctuations. C5. The level of abundance depends ultimately on all the major elements of the ecosystem, although the density-related, controlling factors are the immediate determinants. Only in regard to particular types of situations, or of animals, can more precise statements be made. D. Some related matters are also discussed: D1. The possibility that either physical or biotic factors may be primarily responsible for control in general is examined. Decisions can be reached only about particular types of situations. D2. Some of the ways in which the term `balance' or `equilibrium' has been applied to population relationships are checked against its physical meaning. It is generally inappropriate to any except nearly constant populations, and this applies equally to `dynamic equilibrium'. To prevent confusion, the above terms should not be used in biology without full explanation of the meaning intended. D3. Although population variation is restricted, the view that density generally fluctuates about a mean value, and the related idea that deviations from this mean set up a tendency to return to it, are over-simplifications. The idea that density tends towards a varying level raises the practical difficulty of distinguishing the two sets of variations, but may be useful. D4. The laboratory demonstration of the `classical' oscillations predicted by the mathematical theories has so far proved very difficult. Instead, `relaxation oscillations', in which the predator population kills all the prey and then dies out, have tended to appear. When `refuges' are available, as in nature, remnants of each population normally survive such crashes, and may increase again. In very regular environments, a succession of these cycles might be maintained; in more general terms, a repeated cycle of suppression and release (see C4) might occur. But this is speculative, and perhaps other causes are more important in producing periodic cycles in nature. D5. There is evidence that animal populations fluctuate less violently in very complex ecosystems, for example in tropical forests, than in woods poorer in plant and animal species, and that the most violent fluctuations tend to occur among the animals in plantations of one species, or in barren places like the far north. Also, irregularities in the physical environment (but not in climate), by increasing the complexity of the ecosystem, probably reduce the numerical variability of populations.},

INTRODUCTION The principal problems in studying the dynamics of predation are to explain the observed distribution and abundance of predator and prey populations. The available information allows a rough classification of interactions. Most commonly there is a relatively stable coexistence of predator and prey, dramatically shown from cases of successful biological control (see DeBach 1974). Several laboratory interactions have resulted in the prey becoming extinct (e.g. Gause 1933; Huffaker 1958) and local extinction of prey has also been observed in some field studies (e.g. Brooks & Dodson 1965). Some interactions are characterized by occasional explosive population increases of the prey when predation (and other factors) cease to be limiting; such outbreaks are commonly terminated by over-exploitation of the prey's resources (e.g. Schwertfeger 1935; Clarke 1963). Finally, a few disproportionately documented instances show prey and predator undergoing cyclic oscillations (e.g. Lack 1954; Utida 1957; Huffaker 1958; Miller 1966). An abundance of mathematical models purport to describe the predator-prey relationship in its various aspects (Hassell & May 1973; May 1973; Murdoch & Oaten 1975). These models could be considered satisfactory in that the behaviour they predict can be classified in a way similar to that observed in the real world. Unfortunately, not only do they involve uncorroborated assumptions about predator behaviour, they also involve some assumptions which are known to be false. The challenge is thus dual; first, it involves documenting and explaining the known behaviour of predators, in the hope of arriving at well corroborated general relationships, and second, incorporating these relationships into mathematical models and exploring their implications for the behaviour of predator and prey at the population level. In investigating predator behaviour the level of generality is crucially important and in embarking upon the first of these tasks for a one-predator-one-prey arthropod system we argue for a level of generality that lies between the linear assumptions of a typical population model and the intricate detail of the component approach of Holling (1965, 1966) and his co-workers. Most of the work we refer to comes from studies on insects which are either true predators or parasitoids (often simply called insect parasites). We shall only distinguish between the two categories where there is some difference to be stressed or in connection with particular work. There are two important biological differences between predators and parasites that influence their population dynamics. (a) Only adult female parasites search for hosts, whereas immature as well as mature predators must find prey. The ability of predators to locate prey, therefore, can vary markedly with age (see pp. 145-146). (b) Female parasites oviposit in suitable hosts found.
