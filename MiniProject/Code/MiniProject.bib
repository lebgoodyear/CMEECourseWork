   abstract = {An account is given of the new insight into the theory of magnetic monopoles originating from the work of 't Hooft (1976) and Polyakov (1974). Their magnetic monopole, associated with the conventional electromagnetic gauge group U(1), occurs as a finite-energy smooth soliton solution to an SU(2) gauge theory. A precise picture of its internal structure, the values of its magnetic charge and its mass are obtained. These new developments bring together previously unrelated fields of study, namely the Dirac monopole (with point structure) and the Sine-Gordon soliton in two-dimensional space-time. Properties of more general monopoles, associated with large gauge groups now thought to be relevant in physics, are discussed. Based on this new viewpoint, conjectures can be made about a future quantum theory of monopoles.},

   abstract = {An important and continuing theme of modern solid state physics is the realization of exotic excitations in materials (e.g. quasiparticles) that have no analogy (or have not yet been observed) in the actual physical vacuum of free space. Although they are not fundamental particles, such quasiparticles do constitute the most basic description of the excited states of the "vacuum" in which they reside. In this regard the magnetic textures of the excited states of spin ices, magnetic pyrochlore oxides with dominant Ising interactions, are proposed to be modeled as effective magnetic charge monopoles. Recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments have established the pyrochlore material Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ (YbTO) as a quantum spin ice, where in addition to the Ising interactions there are substantial transverse terms that may induce quantum dynamics and - in principle - coherent monopole motion. Here we report a combined time domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS) and microwave cavity study of YbTO to probe its complex dynamic magnetic susceptibility. We find that the form of the susceptibility is consistent with monopole motion and a magnetic monopole conductivity can be defined and measured. Using the unique phase sensitive capabilities of these techniques, we observe a sign change in the reactive part of the magnetic response. In generic models of monopole motion this is only possible through introducing inertial effects, e.g. a mass dependent term, to the equations of motion. Analogous to conventional electric charge systems, measurement of the conductivity's spectral weight allows us to derive a value for the magnetic monopole mass, which we find to be approximately 1800 electron masses. Our results establish the magnetic monopoles of quantum spin ice as true coherently propagating quasiparticles of this system.},

Indeed, like the stream of electric charges that produces electric current, emergent magnetic monopoles have been observed to roam freely in geometrically frustrated magnets known as spin ice. However, such phenomena demand extreme physical conditions, say, a single spin ice crystal has to be cooled to very low temperature, around 0.36 K. Candidates to overcome this difficulty are their artificial analogues, the so-called artificial spin ices. Here, we demonstrate that a specific unidirectional arrangement of nanoislands yields a peculiar system where magnetic monopoles emerge and are constrained to move along aligned dipoles, providing an ordered flow of magnetic charges at room temperature.},

"Thirty years ago, biologists could get by with a rudimentary grasp of mathematics and modeling. Not so today. In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own. The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves. This innovative book will be an indispensable guide to the world of mathematical models for the next generation of biologists"--Publisher description.

   abstract = {Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are becoming more frequent as climate changes wildlife communities at unprecedented rates, driving population declines and raising concerns for species conservation. One critical disease is the global pandemic of chytridiomycosis in frogs, which can be caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Although there is clear evidence for Bd-induced mortality across high-elevation frog communities, little attention is given to the role of lowlands in Bd's persistence and spread because low elevations are assumed to be too warm to harbor significant levels of Bd. Here, we report widespread Bd infection across 80 frog species from three sites in the lowland Peruvian Amazon, an area with no documented Bd-related amphibian declines. Despite observing no clinical signs of infection in the field, we found that 24-46% of individuals were infected per site (up to ≈105,000 zoospore equivalents per frog) by three Bd strains from the global pandemic lineage (Bd-GPL). We also found collection site and seasonal effects to be only weak predictors of Bd prevalence and load, with lower elevation and drier habitats marginally decreasing both prevalence and load. We found no further effect of host phylogeny, ecotype, or body size. Our results showing high and widespread prevalence across a lowland tropical ecosystem contradict the expectations based on the global pattern of pathogenicity of Bd that is largely restricted to higher elevations and colder temperatures. These findings imply that the lowlands may play a critical role in the spread and persistence of Bd over time and space.},

In Australia several high-elevation species, including the armored mist frog (Litoria lorica), which is designated as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), were believed to have gone extinct during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in the 1980s and early 1990s. Species with greater elevational ranges disappeared from higher elevations, but remained common in the lowlands. In June 2008, we surveyed a stream in a high-elevation dry sclerophyll forest and discovered a previously unknown population of L. lorica and a population of the waterfall frog (Litoria nannotis). We conducted 6 additional surveys in June 2008, September 2008, March 2009, and August 2009. Prevalences of B. dendrobatidis infection (number infected per total sampled) were consistently high in frogs (mean 82.5%, minimum 69%) of both species and in tadpoles (100%) during both winter (starting July) and summer (starting February). However, no individuals of either species showed clinical signs of disease, and they remained abundant (3.25 - 8.75 individuals of L. lorica and 6.5-12.5 individuals of L. nannotis found/person/100 m over 13 months). The high-elevation dry sclerophyll site had little canopy cover, low annual precipitation, and a more defined dry season than a nearby rainforest site, where L. nannotis was more negatively affected by chytridiomycosis. We hypothesize this lack of canopy cover allowed the rocks on which frogs perched to warm up, thereby slowing growth and reproduction of the pathogen on the hosts. In addition, we suggest surveys for apparently extinct or rare species should not be limited to core environments. © 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.},

We detected a significant effect of infection history on metamorph skin microbiota, with reduced bacterial diversity in epizootic populations and differences in community structure and predicted function.

The amphibian skin microbiome can influence disease outcome for several host-pathogen systems, yet little is known of its role in Bsal infection. In addition, many experimental in-vivo amphibian disease studies to date have relied on specimens that have been kept in captivity for long periods without considering the influence of environment on the microbiome and how this may impact the host response to pathogen exposure. We characterised the impact of captivity and exposure to Bsal on the skin bacterial and fungal communities of two co-occurring European newt species, the smooth newt, Lissotriton vulgaris and the great-crested newt, Triturus cristatus. We show that captivity led to significant losses in bacterial and fungal diversity of amphibian skin, which may be indicative of a decline in microbe-mediated protection. We further demonstrate that in both L. vulgaris and T. cristatus, Bsal infection was associated with changes in the composition of skin bacterial communities with possible negative consequences to host health. Our findings advance current understanding of the role of host-associated microbiota in Bsal infection and highlight important considerations for ex-situ amphibian conservation programmes.},

We traced the source of B. dendrobatidis to the Korean peninsula, where one lineage, BdASIA-1, exhibits the genetic hallmarks of an ancestral population that seeded the panzootic.

The infectious disease chytridiomycosis is considered one of the major drivers of global amphibian population decline and extinction and is thought to be caused by a single species of aquatic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. However, several amphibian population declines remain unexplained, among them a steep decrease in fire salamander populations (Salamandra salamandra) that has brought this species to the edge of local extinction. Here we isolated and characterized a unique chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans sp. nov., from this salamander population. This chytrid causes erosive skin disease and rapid mortality in experimentally infected fire salamanders and was present in skin lesions of salamanders found dead during the decline event. Together with the closely related B. dendrobatidis, this taxon forms a well-supported chytridiomycete clade, adapted to vertebrate hosts and highly pathogenic to amphibians. However, the lower thermal growth preference of B. salamandrivorans, compared with B. dendrobatidis, and resistance of midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans) to experimental infection with B. salamandrivorans suggest differential niche occupation of the two chytrid fungi.},

   abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

Here we examine new evidence from various sources to derive an updated estimate of global fungal diversity. The rates and patterns in the description of new species from the 1750s show no sign of approaching an asymptote and even accelerated in the 2010s after the advent of molecular approaches to species delimitation. Species recognition studies of (semi-)cryptic species hidden in morpho-species complexes suggest a weighted average ratio of about an order of magnitude for the number of species recognized after and before such studies. New evidence also comes from extrapolations of plant:fungus ratios, with information now being generated from environmental sequence studies, including comparisons of molecular and fieldwork data from the same sites. We further draw attention to undescribed species awaiting discovery in biodiversity hot spots in the tropics, little-explored habitats (such as lichen-inhabiting fungi), and material in collections awaiting study. We conclude that the commonly cited estimate of 1.5 million species is conservative and that the actual range is properly estimated at 2.2 to 3.8 million. With 120,000 currently accepted species, it appears that at best just 8%, and in the worst case scenario just 3%, are named so far. Improved estimates hinge particularly on reliable statistical and phylogenetic approaches to analyze the rapidly increasing amount of environmental sequence data.},

   abstract = {Infectious diseases have serious impacts on human and wildlife populations, but the effects of a disease can vary, even among individuals or populations of the same host species. Identifying the reasons for this variation is key to understanding disease dynamics and mitigating infectious disease impacts, but disentangling cause and correlation during natural outbreaks is extremely challenging. This study aims to understand associations between symbiotic bacterial communities and an infectious disease, and examines multiple host populations before or after pathogen invasion to infer likely causal links. The results show that symbiotic bacteria are linked to fundamentally different outcomes of pathogen infection: host-pathogen coexistence (endemic infection) or host population extirpation (epidemic infection). Diversity and composition of skin-associated bacteria differed between populations of the frog, Rana sierrae, that coexist with or were extirpated by the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Data from multiple populations sampled before or after pathogen invasion were used to infer cause and effect in the relationship between the fungal pathogen and symbiotic bacteria. Among host populations, variation in the composition of the skin microbiome was most strongly predicted by pathogen infection severity, even in analyses where the outcome of infection did not vary. This result suggests that pathogen infection shapes variation in the skin microbiome across host populations that coexist with or are driven to extirpation by the pathogen. By contrast, microbiome richness was largely unaffected by pathogen infection intensity, but was strongly predicted by geographical region of the host population, indicating the importance of environmental or host genetic factors in shaping microbiome richness. Thus, while both richness and composition of the microbiome differed between endemic and epidemic host populations, the underlying causes are most likely different: pathogen infection appears to shape microbiome composition, while microbiome richness was less sensitive to pathogen-induced disturbance. Because higher richnesswas correlated with host persistence in the presence of Bd, and richness appeared relatively stable to Bd infection, microbiome richness may contribute to disease resistance, although the latter remains to be directly tested.},

We hypothesized cutaneous microbiota would vary across time, and that such variation would be linked to changes in predicted fungal-inhibitory function. We observed significant temporal variation within the aquatic phase, and also between aquatic and terrestrial phase newts. By keeping T. cristatus in mesocosms, we demonstrated that structural changes occurred similarly across individuals, highlighting the non-stochastic nature of the bacterial community succession. Temporal changes were mainly associated with fluctuations in relative abundance rather than full turnover of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Newt skin microbe fluctuations were not correlated with that of pond microbiota; however, a portion of community variation was explained by environmental temperature. Using a database of amphibian skin bacteria that inhibit the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), we found that the proportion of reads associated with 'potentially' Bd-inhibitory OTUs did not vary temporally for two of three newt species, suggesting that protective function may be maintained despite temporal variation in community structure.},

Yet, for most natural systems, we lack a clear understanding of how temperature variability affects structure and composition of skin bacterial communities and, in turn, promotes or limits the colonization of opportunistic pathogens. Here, we examine how natural temperature fluctuations might be related to changes in skin bacterial diversity over time in three amphibian populations infected by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Our focal host species (Eleutherodactylus coqui) is a direct-developing frog that has suffered declines at some populations in the last 20 years, while others have not experienced any changes. We quantified skin bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity at four sampling time points, a period encompassing two seasons and ample variation in natural infections and environmental conditions. Despite the different patterns of infection across populations, we detected an overall increase in bacterial diversity through time, characterized by the replacement of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Increased frog body temperatures possibly allowed the colonization of bacteria as well as the recruitment of a subset of indicator OTUs, which could have promoted the observed changes in diversity patterns. Our results suggest that natural environmental fluctuations might be involved in creating opportunities for bacterial replacement, potentially attenuating pathogen transmission and thus contributing to host persistence in E. coqui populations.},

   abstract = {In an earlier study (Holling, 1959) the basic and subsidiary components of predation were demonstrated in a predator-prey situation involving the predation of sawfly cocoons by small mammals. One of the basic components, termed the functional response,* was a response of the consumption of prey by individual predators to changes of prev densitv, and it appeared to be at least theoretically important in populaticjn reiulation: Because of this importance the functional response has been further examined in an attempt to explain its characteristics. The analytical approach adopted required a predator-prey situation in which the functional response was basically simple and from which more complex types could be developed. An explanation of the basic response would then be the first step towards an explanation of more complex ones, such as those already demonstrated by the small mammals. Artificial predator-prey situations were devised which were found to meet these requirements, and the mathematical equation derived to explain the basic response also appeared to describe the published data concerning the effect of host density upon the number of hosts attacked by insect parasites. Artificial Predator-Prey Situations In the first artificial situation devised the "prey" were sandpaper discs four centimetres in diameter thumb-tacked to a three-foot square table. A blindfolded subject, the 'predator', stood in front of the table and searched for the discs for one minute by tapping with her finger. As each disc was found, it was removed, set to one side and searching continued. Each experiment was replicated eight times at densities of discs ranging from four to 256 per nine sq. ft. The results of one such experiment are shown in Fig. 1, where it can be seen that the number of discs picked up increased at a progressively decreasing rate as the density of discs rose. At first thought one might expect a linear relationship , so that a doubling of the density of discs would result in a doubling of the number of discs picked up, The explanation for the departure from linearity might well involve the time that must be taken to pick up discs and dispose of them, in that at the higher densities, when large numbers of discs are located, a large proportion of the available time must be spent, not in searching, but in removing discs from the table. As a result, the apparent rate of discovery would be lower than at the lower densities where very few discs were found and most of the time available could be spent in actively searching for them. Assuming this explanation to be correct, the simplest expression of the relationship is y = aT,x},

   abstract = {Trophic interactions govern biomass fluxes in ecosystems, and stability in food webs. Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems. Here we show how substantial variation in consumption-rate data, and hence trophic interaction strengths, arises because consumers tend to encounter resources more frequently in three dimensions (3D) (for example, arboreal and pelagic zones) than two dimensions (2D) (for example, terrestrial and benthic zones). By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5.24 × 10 -14 kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0.85) for 2D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1.06) for 3D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0.75) in consumer-resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2,929 consumer-resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {The following is largely the author's summary. In this paper, the model of a basically simple type of predation 52 542, in which the components are rate of searching, the period of exposure of prey to predator and the time spent in handling each prey, is extended to include the effects of hunger. In order to make the model realistic, an analytical approach (the experimental components analysis) was developed to assure an intimate co-ordination between theory and experiment, each alternately dictating the other. The actions and interactions of each subcomponent of the process were analysed experimentally, making use chiefly of laboratory data on the Mantid Hierodula crassa G.-T. preying on Musca domestica L., and equations adequately describing each of the relevant fragments of this system were developed. The aim was to preserve three features that imparted a distinctive character to the complexity of the predation process, namely, the influence of both past and current conditions, the importance of thresholds and limits, and a basic discontinuous character resulting from the relatively few contacts between predator and prey. These three features were preserved by using difference equations and expressing them in Fortran, a language designed for I.B.M. digital computers. Both language and computer (I.B.M. 1620) were ideally suited to deal with the complexity arising from the three features, and since these characterize many biological systems the combination of an experimental components analysis with computer languages and techniques could be profitably applied to many biological problems cf. 55 1373. The resulting predation model accurately predicted the effects of prey density and time on the amount of attack and hunger level shown by the predator. A preliminary simulation study showed that two types of functional response to prey density can be generated, a general case in which the curve shows a negatively accelerated rise to a plateau and a limiting one in which the rise is linear. One or other of these two curves describes the responses of all examples of attack by invertebrate predators (12 species, of which eight are insects and one a mite) for which information is available cf. 49 178; 50 528; 52 489, 545, but not those of vertebrates cf. 55 2004. An extensive simulation study making use of the model to demonstrate the kinds of attack that can occur in nature and the significance of various features of attack with respect to biological control is in progress. The development of simplified versions of the model to enable it to be used in specific situations in the field is proposed and exemplified by a simple equation based on data for H. crassa preying on M. domestica and relating the amount of prey within the predator to the number of prey attacked per day. Output from the complete predation model shows the precise conditions under which such a relation can be used.},

   abstract = {1. We derived a functional response function that accounted for both predator and prey size. Laboratory experiments were then performed to investigate the size relationships of the functional response of the benthic isopod Saduria entomon (L.) feeding on Monoporeia affinis (Lindström) amphipods. 2. The S. entomon predators, in general, showed sigmoid (type III) functional responses. The attack rate of S. entomon was a bent ridge-shaped function of predator and prey size. The maximum attack rates of small predators were found on small prey, and then attack rate declined rapidly as prey size increased. In large predators attack rate increased slowly up to a maximum for large prey. The shape of the attack rate was dependent on the size scaling of predator and prey body mass in the attack rate function. We suggest that the ridge-shaped attack rate function found in our study is likely to be general for predators that feed on prey with a large size range. The handling time of small S. entomon increased rapidly as prey size increased. In contrast, we found only small differences in handling time of large predators. The complete functional response may provide size-refuges for very small and large M. affinis depending on the size-structure of S. entomon. 3. To investigate the realism in our functional response estimates, we incorporated the functional response in a consumption model based on the densities and size-structures of the predator and the prey in the field (Bothnian Sea). We adjusted the attack rate using a correction factor to predict the observed survival of the different age-classes of M. affinis from field samples. The field data-based consumption model accounted for 1 year of size-dependent predation by the size-structured population of S. entomon on M. affinis. In addition, using a growth model for S. entomon we checked that the predicted consumption by the predator gave realistic growth curves. We found that the experimentally derived attack rates may have been overestimated by a factor of 400.},

@report{Jeschke2002,
   abstract = {We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that realistically incorporates handling (i.e., attacking and eating) and digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our model, we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent further foraging activities (i.e., searching and handling). Instead, we let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator searches for new prey. Additionally, our model takes into account time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state, we term it the steady-state satiation (SSS) equation. The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e., asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time, for prey density approaching infinity). According to this formula, maximum predation rate is determined not by the sum of the time spent for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types: handling-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by handling time) and digestion-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by digestion time). We give examples of both predator types. Based on available data, we suggest that most predators are digestion limited. The SSS equation is a conceptual mechanistic model. Two possible applications of this model are that (1) it can be used to calculate the effects of changing predator or prey characteristics (e.g., defenses) on predation rate and (2) optimal foraging models based on the SSS equation are testable alternatives to other approaches. This may improve optimal foraging theory, since one of its major problems has been the lack of alternative models.},

   abstract = {Predator-prey dynamics is most simply and commonly described by Lotka-Volterra-type ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for continuous population density variables in the limit of large population sizes. One popular extension of these ODEs is the so-called Rosenzweig-MacArthur model in which various interaction rates between the populations have a nonlinear dependence on the prey concentration. Nonlinear 'functional responses' of this type were originally proposed by Holling on the basis of a general argument concerning the allocation of a predator's time between two activities: 'prey searching' and 'prey handling'.Although these functional responses are constructed in terms of the behaviour of an individual predator, they are routinely incorporated at the population level in models that include reproduction and death. In this paper we derive a novel three variable model for the simplest possible mathematical formulation of predator-prey dynamics that allows the interplay between these various processes to take place, on their different characteristic timescales. We study its properties in detail and show how it reduces to Holling's functional responses in special limits. As a result we are able to establish direct links between individual-level and population-level behaviour in the context of these well-known functional responses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
