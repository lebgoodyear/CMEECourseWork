This repository contains all the work-in-progress files for my MiniProject.

**Code** contains the scripts/programs.

**Data** is the data needed to run those scripts.

**Results** is where the outpout from those scripts is sent to.

**Sandbox** is a miscellaneous directory containing experimental code and data.

## Requirements

Python v.3.7

Python packages:
- pandas
- scipy
- numpy
- lmfit

R v.3.6.1

R packages:

- ggplot2

Jupyter Notebooks

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux. MacTeX or equivalent is required for LaTeX related files.

## List of scripts
1. [Data_Exploration](#1.-Data_Exploration)
2. [DataPrep](#2.-DataPrep)
3. [fit_functions](Â£3.-fit_functions)
3. [Fit_Models](#4.-Fit_Models)
4. [Plot_Models](#5.-Plot_Models)
5. [MiniProjectFinal](#6.-MiniProjectFinal)

### 1. Data_Exploration

A Jupyter Notebook to explore the datset.

### 2. DataPrep

A .R script to do intial plotting and prepare the data for fitting.

### 3. fit_functions

A .py module that contains all the necessary functions for Fit_Models to run.

### 4. Fit_Models

A .py script to fit a polynomial model and the general functional response model to the data. It imports fit_functions.

### 5. Plot_Models

A .R script to plot the models with the data. NOT YET COMPLETE.

### 6. MiniProjectFinal
