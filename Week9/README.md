*Author: Lucy Goodyear*  
*Created: 27/11/19*

This repository contains all the CMEE coursework from Week 9 on HPC.

**Code** contains the scripts/programs.

**Results** is where the output from those scripts is sent to, including those from the cluster run.

**Submission** contains the final documents for submission, zipped and unzipped.

## Requirements

R v.3.6.1

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux.

## List of scripts
1. [leg19_HPC_2019_main](#1.-leg19_HPC_2019_main)
2. [leg19_HPC_2019_cluster](#1.-leg19_HPC_2019_cluster)
3. [leg19_run_simulation](#3.-leg19_run_simulation)
4. [leg19_HPC_2019_test](#4.-leg19_HPC_2019_test)
5. [leg19_HPC_2019_ChallengeG](#5.-leg19_HPC_2019_ChallengeG)

### 1. leg19_HPC_2019_main

A .R script containing all the neutral theory functions needed to generate data on the cluster and also all the functions that produce fractals.

### 2. leg19_HPC_2019_cluster

A .R script on neutral theory to run the functions in the main programme on the cluster.

### 3. leg19_run_simulation

A copy of the bash script saved to the cluster to queue for me and run the cluster programme.

### 4. leg19_HPC_2019_test

A .R script that sources the main programme to test the functions on sample data.

### 5. leg19_HPC_2019_ChallengeG

A self-sufficient R script containing question 30 from the main programme but written in as few characters as possible (164).
