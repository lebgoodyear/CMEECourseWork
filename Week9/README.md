R v.3.6.1

All code has been created for Mac so there may be a few differences in commands with respect to Linux.

3. [run_hpc.sh](#3.-run_hpc)
4. [leg19_HPC_2019_test](#4.-leg19_HPC_2019_test)

### 1. leg19_HPC_2019_main

A .R script containing all the neutral theory functions needed to generate data on the cluster and also all the functions that produce fractals.

### 2. leg19_HPC_2019_cluster

A .R script on neutral theory to run the functions in the main programme on the cluster.

### 3. run_hpc

A copy of the bash script saved to the cluster to queue for me and run the cluster programme.
